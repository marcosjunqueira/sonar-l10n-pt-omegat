<p>Protected methods that are never used by any classes in the same
	project are strongly suspected to be dead code. Dead code means
	unnecessary, inoperative code that should be removed. This helps in
	maintenance by decreasing the maintained code size, making it easier to
	understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.</p>
<p>In the following case, unused protected methods are not
	considered as dead code by Sonar :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Protected methods which override a method from a parent class.</li>
	<li>Protected methods of an abstract class.</li>
</ul>
