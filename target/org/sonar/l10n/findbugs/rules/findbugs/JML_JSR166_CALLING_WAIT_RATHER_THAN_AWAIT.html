<p>This method calls <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code> or <code>notifyAll()</code> on an object that also 
provides an <code>await()</code>, <code>signal()</code>, <code>signalAll()</code> method (such as util.concurrent 
Condition objects). This probably isn't what you want, and even if you do want it, you should consider changing your 
design, as other developers will find it exceptionally confusing.</p>
