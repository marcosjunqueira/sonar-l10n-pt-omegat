<p>This code invoked a compareTo or compare method, and checks to see if the return value is a specific 
value, such as 1 or -1. When invoking these methods, you should only check the sign of the result, not 
for any specific non-zero value. While many or most compareTo and compare methods only return -1, 0 or 1, 
some of them will return other values.</p>
