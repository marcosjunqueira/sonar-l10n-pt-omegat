<p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is measured by the number of (&&, ||)
	operators and (if, while, do, for, ?:, catch, switch, case, return,
	throw) statements in the body of a class plus one for each constructor,
	method (but not getter/setter), static initializer, or instance
	initializer in the class. The last return stament in method, if exists,
	is not taken into account.</p>
<p>
	Even when the Cyclomatic Complexity of a class is very high, this
	complexity might be well distributed among all methods. Nevertheless,
	most of the time, a very complex class is a class which breaks the <a

		Responsibility Principle</a> and which should be re-factored to be split
	in several classes.
