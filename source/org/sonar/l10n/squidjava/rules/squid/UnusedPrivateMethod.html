<p>Private methods that are never executed are dead code. Dead code
	means unnecessary, inoperative code that should be removed. This helps
	in maintenance by decreasing the maintained code size, making it easier
	to understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.</p>
<p>In the following two cases, private methods are not considered as
	dead code by Sonar :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Private empty constructors that are intentionally used to
		prevent any direct instantiation of a class.</li>
	<li>Private methods : readObject(...), writeObject(...),
		writeReplace(...), readResolve(...) which can contractually be used
		when implementing the Serializable interface.</li>
</ul>
