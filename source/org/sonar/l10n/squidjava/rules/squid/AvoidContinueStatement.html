<p>The use of the 'continue' branching statement increase the
	essential complexity of the source code and so prevent any refactoring
	of this source code to replace all well structured control structures
	with a single statement.</p>
<p>For instance, in the following java program fragment, it's not
	possible to apply the 'extract method' refactoring pattern :</p>
<pre>
mylabel : for(int i = 0 ; i< 3; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < 4 ; j++) {
    doSomething();
    if (checkSomething()) {
      continue mylabel;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
