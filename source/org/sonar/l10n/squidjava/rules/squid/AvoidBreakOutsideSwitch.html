<p>The use of the 'break' branching statement increases the
	essential complexity of the source code and so prevents any refactoring
	of this source code to replace all well structured control structures
	with a single statement.</p>
<p>For instance, with the following java program fragment, it's not
	possible to apply the 'extract method' refactoring pattern :</p>
<pre>
mylabel : for (int i = 0 ; i< 3; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < 4 ; j++) {
    doSomething();
    if (checkSomething()) {
      break mylabel;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The use of the 'break' branching statement is only authorized
	inside a 'switch' statement.</p>
