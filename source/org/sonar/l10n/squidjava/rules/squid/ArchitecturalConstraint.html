<p>A source code comply to an architectural model when it fully
	adheres to a set of architectural constraints. A constraint allows to
	deny references between classes by pattern.</p>
<p>You can for instance use this rule to :</p>
<ul>
	<li>forbid access to **.web.** from **.dao.** classes</li>
	<li>forbid access to java.util.Vector, java.util.Hashtable and
		java.util.Enumeration from any classes</li>
	<li>forbid access to java.sql.** from **.ui.** and **.web.**
		classes</li>
</ul>
