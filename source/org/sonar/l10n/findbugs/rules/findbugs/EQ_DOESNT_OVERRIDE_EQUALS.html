<p> This class extends a class that defines an equals method and adds fields, but doesn't
define an equals method itself. Thus, equality on instances of this class will
ignore the identity of the subclass and the added fields. Be sure this is what is intended,
and that you don't need to override the equals method. Even if you don't need to override
the equals method, consider overriding it anyway to document the fact
that the equals method for the subclass just return the result of
invoking super.equals(o).
