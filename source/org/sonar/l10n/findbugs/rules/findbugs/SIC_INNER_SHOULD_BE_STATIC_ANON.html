<p> This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference
  to the object which created it.&nbsp; This reference makes the instances
  of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object
  alive longer than necessary.&nbsp; If possible, the class should be
  made into a <em>static</em> inner class. Since anonymous inner
classes cannot be marked as static, doing this will require refactoring
the inner class so that it is a named inner class.</p>
