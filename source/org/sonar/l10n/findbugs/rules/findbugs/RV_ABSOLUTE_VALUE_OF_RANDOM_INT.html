<p> This code generates a random signed integer and then computes
the absolute value of that random integer.  If the number returned by the random number
generator is <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>, then the result will be negative as well (since 
<code>Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>).
