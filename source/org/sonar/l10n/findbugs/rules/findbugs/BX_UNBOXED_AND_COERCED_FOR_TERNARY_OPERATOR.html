<p>A wrapped primitive value is unboxed and converted to another primitive type as part of the
evaluation of a conditional ternary operator (the <code> b ? e1 : e2</code> operator). The
semantics of Java mandate that if <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code> are wrapped
numeric values, the values are unboxed and converted/coerced to their common type (e.g,
if <code>e1</code> is of type <code>Integer</code> 
and <code>e2</code> is of type <code>Float</code>, then <code>e1</code> is unboxed,
converted to a floating point value, and boxed. See JLS Section 15.25.
