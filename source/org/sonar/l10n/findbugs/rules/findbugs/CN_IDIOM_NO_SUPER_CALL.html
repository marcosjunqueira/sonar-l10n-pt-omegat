<p> This non-final class defines a clone() method that does not call super.clone().
If this class ("<i>A</i>") is extended by a subclass ("<i>B</i>"),
and the subclass <i>B</i> calls super.clone(), then it is likely that
<i>B</i>'s clone() method will return an object of type <i>A</i>,
which violates the standard contract for clone().</p>

<p> If all clone() methods call super.clone(), then they are guaranteed
to use Object.clone(), which always returns an object of the correct type.</p>
