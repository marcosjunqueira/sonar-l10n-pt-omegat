<p> This method returns a value that is not checked. The return value should be checked
since it can indicate an unusual or unexpected function execution. For
example, the <code>File.delete()</code> method returns false
if the file could not be successfully deleted (rather than 
throwing an Exception).
If you don't check the result, you won't notice if the method invocation
signals unexpected behavior by returning an atypical return value.
