<p>In some situation, this compareTo or compare method returns the constant Integer.MIN_VALUE, 
which is an exceptionally bad practice. The only thing that matters about the return value of 
compareTo is the sign of the result. But people will sometimes negate the return value of compareTo, 
expecting that this will negate the sign of the result. And it will, except in the case where 
the value returned is Integer.MIN_VALUE. So just return -1 rather than Integer.MIN_VALUE.</p>
