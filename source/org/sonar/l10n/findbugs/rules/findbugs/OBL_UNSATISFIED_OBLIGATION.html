      This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream,
      database object, or other
      resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation.
      </p>
      <p>
      In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource,
      the method should use a try/finally block to ensure that
      the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method
      returns.
      </p>
      <p>
      This bug pattern is essentially the same as the
      OS_OPEN_STREAM and ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE
      bug patterns, but is based on a different
      (and hopefully better) static analysis technique.
      We are interested is getting feedback about the
      usefulness of this bug pattern.
      To send feedback, either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>send email to findbugs@cs.umd.edu</li>
        <li>file a bug report: <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/reportingBugs.html">http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/reportingBugs.html</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      In particular,
      the false-positive suppression heuristics for this
      bug pattern have not been extensively tuned, so
      reports about false positives are helpful to us.
      </p>

      See Weimer and Necula, <i>Finding and Preventing Run-Time Error Handling Mistakes</i>, for
      a description of the analysis technique.
