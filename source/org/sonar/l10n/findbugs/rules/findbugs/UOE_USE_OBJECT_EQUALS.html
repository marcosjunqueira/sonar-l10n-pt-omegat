      This method invokes the .equals(Object o) method on a final class that doesn't override the equals method
      in the Object class, effectively making the equals method test for sameness, like ==. It is good to use
      the .equals method, but you should consider adding an .equals method in this class.

      <p>[Bill Pugh]: Sorry, but I strongly disagree that this should be a warning, and I think your code
      is just fine. Users of your code shouldn't care how you've implemented equals(), and they should never
      depend on == to compare instances, since that bypasses the libraries ability to control how objects
      are compared.
