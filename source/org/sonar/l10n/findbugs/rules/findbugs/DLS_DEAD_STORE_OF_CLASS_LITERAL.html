This instruction assigns a class literal to a variable and then never uses it.
<a href="//java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/compatibility.html#literal">The behavior of this differs in Java 1.4 and in Java 5.</a>
In Java 1.4 and earlier, a reference to <code>Foo.class</code> would force the static initializer
for <code>Foo</code> to be executed, if it has not been executed already.
In Java 5 and later, it does not.

for more details and examples, and suggestions on how to force class initialization in Java 5.
