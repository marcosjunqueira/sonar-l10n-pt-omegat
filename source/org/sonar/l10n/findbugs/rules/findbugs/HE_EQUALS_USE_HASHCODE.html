<p> This class overrides <code>equals(Object)</code>, but does not
  override <code>hashCode()</code>, and inherits the implementation of
  <code>hashCode()</code> from <code>java.lang.Object</code> (which returns
  the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object
  by the VM).&nbsp; Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the
  invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.</p>

<p>If you don't think instances of this class will ever be inserted into a HashMap/HashTable,
the recommended <code>hashCode</code> implementation to use is:</p>
<pre>public int hashCode() {
  assert false : "hashCode not designed";
  return 42; // any arbitrary constant will do 
  }</pre>
