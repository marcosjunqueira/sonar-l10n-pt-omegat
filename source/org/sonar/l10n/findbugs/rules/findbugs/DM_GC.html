<p> Code explicitly invokes garbage collection.
  Except for specific use in benchmarking, this is very dubious.</p>
  <p>In the past, situations where people have explicitly invoked
  the garbage collector in routines such as close or finalize methods
  has led to huge performance black holes. Garbage collection
   can be expensive. Any situation that forces hundreds or thousands
   of garbage collections will bring the machine to a crawl.</p>
