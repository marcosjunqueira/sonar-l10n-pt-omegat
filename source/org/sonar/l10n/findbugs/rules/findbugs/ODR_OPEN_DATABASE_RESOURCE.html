<p> The method creates a database resource (such as a database connection
or row set), does not assign it to any
fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close
the object on all paths out of the method.&nbsp; Failure to
close database resources on all paths out of a method may
result in poor performance, and could cause the application to
have problems communicating with the database.
