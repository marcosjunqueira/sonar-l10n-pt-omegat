        A value specified as not carrying a type qualifier annotation is guaranteed
        to be consumed in a location or locations requiring that the value does
        carry that annotation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=NEVER
        is guaranteed to reach a use or uses where the same type qualifier specifies when=ALWAYS.
