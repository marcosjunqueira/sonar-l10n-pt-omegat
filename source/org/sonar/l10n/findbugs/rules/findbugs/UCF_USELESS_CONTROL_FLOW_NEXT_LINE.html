<p> This method contains a useless control flow statement in which control
flow follows to the same or following line regardless of whether or not
the branch is taken.
Often, this is caused by inadvertently using an empty statement as the
body of an <code>if</code> statement, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
    if (argv.length == 1);
        System.out.println("Hello, " + argv[0]);
</pre>
