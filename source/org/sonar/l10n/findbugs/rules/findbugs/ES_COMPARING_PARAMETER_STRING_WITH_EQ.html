<p>This code compares a <code>java.lang.String</code> parameter for reference
equality using the == or != operators. Requiring callers to 
pass only String constants or interned strings to a method is unnecessarily
fragile, and rarely leads to measurable performance gains. Consider
using the <code>equals(Object)</code> method instead.</p>
