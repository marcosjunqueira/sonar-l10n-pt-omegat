<p>This code compares <code>java.lang.String</code> objects for reference
equality using the == or != operators.
Unless both strings are either constants in a source file, or have been
interned using the <code>String.intern()</code> method, the same string
value may be represented by two different String objects. Consider
using the <code>equals(Object)</code> method instead.</p>
