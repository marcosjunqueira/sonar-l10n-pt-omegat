The software uses an HTTP request parameter to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory,
but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of absolute path traversal.
If FindBugs found <em>any</em>, you <em>almost certainly</em> have more
vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about absolute path traversal, you should seriously
consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.
