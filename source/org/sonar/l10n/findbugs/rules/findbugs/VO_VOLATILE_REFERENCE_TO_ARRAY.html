<p>This declares a volatile reference to an array, which might not be what
you want. With a volatile reference to an array, reads and writes of
the reference to the array are treated as volatile, but the array elements
are non-volatile. To get volatile array elements, you will need to use
one of the atomic array classes in java.util.concurrent (provided
in Java 5.0).</p>
