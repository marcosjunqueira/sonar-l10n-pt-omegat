<p> This method compares an expression of the form (e | C) to D.
which will always compare unequal
due to the specific values of constants C and D.
This may indicate a logic error or typo.</p>

<p> Typically, this bug occurs because the code wants to perform
a membership test in a bit set, but uses the bitwise OR
operator ("|") instead of bitwise AND ("&amp;").</p>
