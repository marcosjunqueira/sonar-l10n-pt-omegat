      Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. 
      Try to keep your class names simple and descriptive. Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations 
      (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).
