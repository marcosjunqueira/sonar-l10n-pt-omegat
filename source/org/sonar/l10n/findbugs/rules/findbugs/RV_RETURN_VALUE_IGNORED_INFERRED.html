<p>This code calls a method and ignores the return value. The return value is the same type as the type the 
method is invoked on, and from our analysis it looks like the return value might be important (e.g., like 
ignoring the return value of <code>String.toLowerCase()</code>).
</p>
<p>We are guessing that ignoring the return value might be a bad idea just from a simple analysis of the 
body of the method. You can use a <code>@CheckReturnValue</code> annotation to instruct FindBugs as to whether 
ignoring the return value of this method is important or acceptable.<p>
<p>Please investigate this closely to decide whether it is OK to ignore the return value. </p>
