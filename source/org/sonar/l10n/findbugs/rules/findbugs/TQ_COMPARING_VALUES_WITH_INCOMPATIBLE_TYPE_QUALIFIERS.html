<p>
A value specified as carrying a type qualifier annotation is
compared with a value that doesn't ever carry that qualifier.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=ALWAYS
is compared with a value that where the same type qualifier specifies when=NEVER.
</p>

<p>
For example, say that @NonNegative is a nickname for
the type qualifier annotation @Negative(when=When.NEVER).
The following code will generate this warning because
the return statement requires a @NonNegative value,
but receives one that is marked as @Negative.
</p>
<pre>
public boolean example(@Negative Integer value1, @NonNegative Integer value2) {
  return value1.equals(value2);
}
</pre>
