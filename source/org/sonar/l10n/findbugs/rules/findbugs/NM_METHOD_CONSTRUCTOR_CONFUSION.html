<p> This regular method has the same name as the class it is defined in. It is likely that this was intended to be a constructor.
      If it was intended to be a constructor, remove the declaration of a void return value.
	If you had accidently defined this method, realized the mistake, defined a proper constructor
	but can't get rid of this method due to backwards compatibility, deprecate the method.
