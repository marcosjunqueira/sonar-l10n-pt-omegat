<p> A method, field or class declares a generic signature where a non-hashable class
is used in context where a hashable class is required.
A class that declares an equals method but inherits a hashCode() method
from Object is unhashable, since it doesn't fulfill the requirement that
equal objects have equal hashCodes.
