<p> This method contains a useless control flow statement, where
control flow continues onto the same place regardless of whether or not
the branch is taken. For example,
this is caused by having an empty statement
block for an <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<pre>
    if (argv.length == 0) {
	// TODO: handle this case
	}
</pre>
