<p> Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields
  exposes the internal representation of the object.&nbsp;
   If instances
   are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to
   the mutable object would compromise security or other
   important properties, you will need to do something different.
  Returning a new copy of the object is better approach in many situations.</p>
