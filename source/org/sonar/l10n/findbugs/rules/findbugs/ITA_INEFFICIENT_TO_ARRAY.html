<p> This method uses the toArray() method of a collection derived class, and passes
in a zero-length prototype array argument.  It is more efficient to use
<code>myCollection.toArray(new Foo[myCollection.size()])</code>
If the array passed in is big enough to store all of the
elements of the collection, then it is populated and returned
directly. This avoids the need to create a second array
(by reflection) to return as the result.</p>
