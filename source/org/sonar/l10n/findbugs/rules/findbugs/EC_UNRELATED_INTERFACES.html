<p> This method calls equals(Object) on two references of unrelated
interface types, where neither is a subtype of the other,
and there are no known non-abstract classes which implement both interfaces.
Therefore, the objects being compared
are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime
(unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class
loading can occur at runtime).
According to the contract of equals(),
objects of different
classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the
contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object),
the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime.
