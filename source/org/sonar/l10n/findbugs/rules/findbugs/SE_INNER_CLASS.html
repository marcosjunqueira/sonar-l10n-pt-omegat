<p> This Serializable class is an inner class.  Any attempt to serialize
it will also serialize the associated outer instance. The outer instance is serializable,
so this won't fail, but it might serialize a lot more data than intended.
If possible, making the inner class a static inner class (also known as a nested class) should solve the 
problem.
