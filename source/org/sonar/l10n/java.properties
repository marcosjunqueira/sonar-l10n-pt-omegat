# IMPORTANT: the bundle for the Java plugin (and the corresponding rule descriptions in the "java" fodler) are currently located here
#            because the sonar-java-plugin is currently a Core plugin. They should be moved out and placed inside the Java Plugin once
#            (or if one day) the plugin is pulled out of the Sonar Platform to be an independant plugin (like any other language plugin).
